  \section{Results}

  Our implementation produces the expected results on all input--output file pairs. The current implementation has been developed with python. 
 

  \section{Implementation details}

  	The men's preferences are stored in a dictionary where each key consists of a man and its value consists on an ordered list of women.  %
  	\sidenote{ \{
  		"Wayne": ["Chicago","Boston","Detroit"],
  		"Val":["Boston","Detroit","Chicago"],
  		"Xavier":["Detroit","Boston","Chicago"]
  		\}
  	} 
	The same dictionary structure is used for the womens priority list. Each match is represented as a list where m,w are [w,m] and such list is stored in the final matchings list. In order to improve the algorithm, once a man (let's call \textit{m} to these handsome man) has been matched with a women (\textit{w}), \textit{w} is removed from man's priority list. Therefore, if the match between \textit{m} and \textit{w} is unmatched due another man (\textit{m'}) has a higher priority than \textit{m} in \textit{w}, m will not ask again to \textit{w} because \textit{w} has been "discarted" for him. 
	
	
	We can check find a free man who has not proposed to every woman in time $[\ldots]$, because we store $[\ldots]$.
	
	With these data structures, our implementation runs in time $O(n^2)$ %

		Replace with your actual running time.
	} on inputs with $n$ men and $n$ women.
