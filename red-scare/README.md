==========================================

Requirements
-----------------

* Python 3.7
* The NetworkX package for Python. Can be installed by running `pip install networkx`.

Running the program
-------------------

The main is `runner.py` as such this is the file to run. It takes the contents of a text file as input.
Typically from the command line it's `py runner.py < [filepath]` or `python3 runner.py < [filepath]`, where `[filepath]` represents the path to the input file.

Alternatively, you can run `./run.sh` from the terminal (Linux / MacOS only) to execute the program for all the input files in the `./data/` folder.

Typical output example can be found in the file `./results.txt`.
